# Product’s Business Market:
The India online grocery market size was valued at USD 2.9 billion in 2020 and is
expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.1% from 2021 to
2028. The market has gained immense traction over the past months on account of the
changing lifestyle of the consumers, growing urbanization, and the tech-savvy
generation who prefers buying products online. With the growth in disposable incomes
and busier lifestyles, people are increasingly seeking out customizable and convenient
online platforms for grocery shopping instead of walking down to the neighborhood
vendors. The preference for online delivery of grocery products became more visible
following the COVID-19 outbreak. With the social distancing standards, consumers are
turning their focus to online grocery shopping, which is not only convenient but is a safer
option.

The Indian ecommerce market is one of the biggest in the world. And why does that
matter? Because, as per Statista, the Indian eCommerce market will be having 1,090
million users by 2027 against the global count of 5,290 million.
